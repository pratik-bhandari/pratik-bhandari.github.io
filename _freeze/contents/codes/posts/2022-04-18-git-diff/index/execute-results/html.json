Cool.\\ -->\n\n***\n\nOne of the main reasons for using git is *version control*.\nNo longer naming the files as 'final-draft', 'finaly-draft2', 'final-finaldraft_pb', etc.\nYou can see what changes have been made incrementally:\nCompare the version of the document created 10 days ago with the recent one.\n\n#### Example:\n\nSay we have a file `01_chapter.Rmd`.\nIt is the first chapter of my thesis.\nI have just made some changes in it.\nBefore `git add <file>`, I want to compare these changes with the latest version that I have already committed.\nThen, this is what I do^[\nMore in [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5586383/how-to-diff-one-file-to-an-arbitrary-version-in-git)]:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngit diff HEAD 01_chapter.Rmd\n# OR\ngit diff master:01_chapter.Rmd 01_chapter.Rmd\n```\n:::\n\nIf `01_chapter.Rmd` is not in the working directory then provide the path to it.\n\nOther different comparisons:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngit diff HEAD~2 01_chapter.Rmd\n# OR\ngit diff master~2:01_chapter.Rmd 01_chapter.Rmd\n#--\n\ngit diff master~3:01_chapter.Rmd master~1:01_chapter.Rmd\n```\n:::\n\nYou got the idea.\n\nThe global comparison of all files is just `git diff` which I do not prefer.\\\n\nTip: If you are working on RStudio, its GUI shows the changes in files since the last commit, including what files are added or deleted.",
