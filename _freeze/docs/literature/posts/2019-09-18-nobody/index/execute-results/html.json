Who are you?*](https://poets.org/poem/im-nobody-who-are-you-260)]\nWho are you?\nAre you nobody?\\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  Yes, I am nobody.\\\nOh, I am also nobody.\\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  I see.\\\nDo you see? Really?\\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\tAh hmm.\\\nYou are nobody, I am nobody\\\nAnd we both make a pair of nobody-s\\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\tThe world is full of nobody-s, don’t you see?\\\nReally? I only see somebody in everybody.\\\n<!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -->\n_(Well, you said you are nobody though,_\\\n<!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -->\n_Or is it I who insisted?_\\\n<!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -->\n_Nevermind, nuances do not matter to nobody-s -- that’s what everybody says)_\\\nThere is always somebody in everybody, but not me.\\\nI am a void -- just empty\\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\tYeah, I was too\\\nDon't sitck your oar,\\\nDon’t interrupt!\\\nnobody-s don’t have rights to interrupt\\\nto speak out\\\nNobody-s are supposed to listen\\\nAren’t you Pavloved by now?\\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\t(I thought you were used to being interrupted...sigh)\\\nYou should know that I know you are empty too: just like Me,\\\nready to be filled in but the lid closed by everybody: somebody day-by-day, and nobody every day\\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\tAren’t you at home with the void by now?\\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n***(silence)***\n\n\n_Republished in April 2021_",
