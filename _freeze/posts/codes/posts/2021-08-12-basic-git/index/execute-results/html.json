Then I create a local R project in R Studio, and connect it to the remote git repo. The 'how-to' of this process can be found online; I'll write up a brief overview, probably.\n\nThis post is to remind myself of most frequently used git commands.\n\n<!-- When you click on 'New Project' on the top right drop down menu, R Studio give you three choices and one of them is to *Checkout a project from a version control repository*.-->\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Push local changes to the remote repo:\ngit push -u origin master\n\n# Creat and checkout new branch:\ngit checkout -b NewBranchName\n\ngit push -u origin BranchIamWorkingOn # to push from local repo to remote repo if the remote repo doesn't have this `BranchIamWorkinOn` setup up already\n\n# Delete a local branch:\ngit branch -D BranchToBeDeleted\n```\n:::\nBe careful on deleting. The `-D` is a hard delete! \n\n\nMerge branches locally:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngit checkout main #First switch to the main/master branch\ngit merge BranchIwantToMerge #The branch still exists after merging\n```\n:::\n\nThis was a dirty note down as I frequently make mistakes using these commands. `git pull`, `git merge`, etc. are also used but not much problematically.\n\nTune in for more frequently used `R` and `bash` scripts :D",
