(It is a different topic, how beneficial conferences are.) Here I am curating a list of conferences some of which I have attended seem worth sharing, and some of which I‚Äôd like to attend.  This is nowhere near an exhaustive list and will be updated regularly. If it helps you, great! If not, at least I have a bookmark for myself  üòÖ \n\n\nProgram\nDate\nFormat\nAnnual meeting of Cognitive Neuroscience Society (CNS)\nMarch 13 - March 16\nOnline\nAPS International Convention of Psychological Science (ICPS)\nMay 26 - May 27\nOnline\nMeeting of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA)\nJune 08 - June 10\nOnline\nSociety for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS 2021)\nJune 23 - June 25\nOnline\nAnnual conference of the Cognitive Science Society (CogSci)\nJuly 26 - July 29\nOnline\nInterspeech\nAugust 30 - September 03\nHybrid\nArchitectures and Mechanisms for Language Processing (AMLaP)\nSeptember 02 - September 04\nHybrid\nSociety for the Neurobiology of Language (SNL)\nOctober 05 - October 08\nOnline\nNeuroscience 2021 - Society for Neuroscience (SfN)\nNovember 13 - November 17\nOn-site\nSymposium for Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience (SCAN)\nthroughout 2021\nOnline\nJoint Conference on Language Evolution, 2022\ntbd\nHybrid\nOkay fine!

    "contents": "\nAs of 23 May, in a country of 30 million people, more than 513 thousand have lost their lives to covid1. Daily deaths, active cases and daily new cases are all increasing very rapidly; everything seems out of control! Many covid-related deaths are due to the lack of oxygen supply, ventilators, critical care units, human resources, and just hospital beds. Once a patient dies, another one gets the bed. I can‚Äôt begin to imagine what it must be like to the patients and their families, the doctors and nurses triaging life and death. Those ambulance drivers whose ambulance is on a hold because there‚Äôs a patient in there waiting for a bed in a hospital while the driver gets a call from another family asking to rush another patient to the hospital. God forbid, at the end, if both the patients were to die without reaching the hospital‚Ä¶\nWith its limited resources and the ongoing suicidal political games, the government is failing to deliver emergency medical supplies and vaccines. Nevertheless, our prime minister has recently pledged for help from the UK and other G7 nations2. Yesterday, the UN has appealed to the international community to provide aid to Nepal to overcome this humanitarian crisis. Countries like Switzerland3 and China have sent some supplies but it is not enough. Nepalis living abroad are collecting funds to buy oxygen concentrators and oxygen cylinders and are sending them home. While the effort is rightfully on oxygen supply, another important aspect of covid control is overlooked.Dr.¬†Anup Subedee, a medical doctor and an infectious disease expert in Nepal has recently written about it on Twitter in response to questions about how people outside Nepal can help. Below is a part of his tweet thread.\n\nThere‚Äôs too little happening in terms of public health response to the pandemic surge- test/trace/isolate & quarantine/vaccinate ‚Äì the only interventions that can reduce the number of new cases in community‚Ä¶ Since there is no system to intervene in the community, we‚Äôll be back in square one as soon as we loosen the lockdown.\nCurrently the test positivity rates are around 45% nationally ‚Äì> the real number of daily new cases is many times higher than the reported numbers. People are not getting tested because of lack of kits in towns and villages and border checkpoints.\nIf we were to invest primarily in testing ‚Äì antigen and PCR kits, many more positive cases will be identified.\nCool thing about testing: testing alone will help drive some level of contact tracing, isolation and quarantine without the state‚Äôs intervention. Once you identify someone as positive, they tend to self-isolate, try to protect dear ones, & neighbors will be more careful.\nPathway for such testing drive: Symptoms present-> antigen test. Ag test positive-> treat as COVID case. Ag test negative-> send PCR swab and isolate. Asymptomatic, exposed to someone with COVID-> PCR test after quarantine period\n  While some are working on immediate priorities like oxygen supply, others should think about how they can help to mitigate the pandemic spreading like wildfire in the community. Let‚Äôs help run these massive test campaigns that are so acutely needed in our communities  .\n\nNow the question is how can you send the test kits to Nepal? All the international flights to Nepal are closed. Only cargo flights are operational. I see there are two options available:\nSend funds directly to an NGO/INGO, or a government agency who can buy the testing kits.\nBuy the kits and send them to Nepal.\nFor example, Non-Residential Nepali Association, Germany is raising funds to buy oxygen-concentrators and send them directly to Nepal in coordination with the embassies. This seems like a good model.\nWhichever options you choose, it is better to collaborate with like-minded people, i.e., those who want to save Nepali lives, and coordinate with the country‚Äôs government and Nepal Embassy. I am hopeful this approach will work out. If you have other faster ways of delivery, do comment below so that we can collaborate.\nAlong with this, you can also support organizations like Health foundation Nepal that is running psychological counseling and telemedicine for covid patients.\nAgain, we need oxygen; we also need testing kits.\nGotta rush. Our small effort can help save lives!!\n\nData from Worldometer‚Ü©Ô∏é\nOpinion piece by Nepal‚Äôs prime minister KP Sharma Oli in the Guradian‚Ü©Ô∏é\nPress release by Swiss government‚Ü©Ô∏é\n",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\nI was first introduced to formal practice of meditation when I was in lower secondory school. After that there were many instances of following spiritual schools and gurus for the sake of learning how to meditate. It was never consistent and I was never consistent. In the past few months, I have been fairly consistent meditating just by myself. Without a teacher, however, learning the skill of meditation is not an easy task to undertake. After weighing the pros and cons, I decided to learn from a teacher, from someone who is trained and knows better, someone who can teach. I came across this app by Sam Harris in which there are different courses and routes of meditation practice including one for beginners. [Sam is generally known for his expression on politics, philosophy and religion. But this is not my concern at the moment.] Today marks the 25th day of my regular practice of following the guided meditation. I would recommend it to anyone. With the practice, I have begun to realize those aspects of ‚Äòmyself‚Äô that had gone unnoticed earlier, or had been noticed in readings. I have questions about life and existence, about self and consciousness more than ever before. Probably this also depends on what one seeks from meditation. Why do you (want to) meditate? Do you think that meditation is the remedy to all the problems in your life: stress, negative emotions, anger and so on? Maybe this is not the right approach to meditation, I opine. I definitely do not qualify to make a seasoned claim. But gleaning what I have glimpsed in recent days and what I had learnt from my intermittent practice in the past is that meditation is not the means to attain those ends. Meditation, I think, is about being mindful of the existence ‚Äì existence of thoughts, emotions, feelings, sensations in one‚Äôs conscious awareness. Realizing and observing that all what we experience in our waking hours (probably while we sleep as well) are merely the appearance of those experiences in the field of conscious awareness. And we identify this experience as ‚Äòself‚Äô, an illusory self. This realization, even if momentary in the beginning, is enlightening [I am not using the word ‚Äòenlightening‚Äô in the same sense that is used in different Buddhits and Hindu traditions.] I can‚Äôt say for sure if I am under an illusion that I have glimpsed it: there are instances during meditation when I have momentarily observed the non-existence of ‚Äòself‚Äô; there is no ‚ÄòI‚Äô. This might as well an illusion at the end. With time and practice, things will be clearer for me. Afterall, you can see how many times the word ‚ÄòI‚Äô has been used in this writing ‚Äì the self is so dominant. And semantics does matter, doesn‚Äôt it?\n\n\n\n",
