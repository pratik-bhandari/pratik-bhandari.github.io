<!-- Oh, so some links brought you here. Cool.\ -->

Many of my colleagues who consider themselves 'doing' cognitive science don't seem to be aware of the conferences that the other person in the group attends.
Cog. Sci. is a broad field, and it is not possible to keep up with the conferences, journals, and publications across all domains. 
Nonetheless, it might be helpful to keep track of, and attend if possible, the conferences that cover the common areas of interest.
Here I am curating a list of conferences, some of which I have attended and some I'd like to attend.

<br> This is nowhere near an exhaustive list; it is updated regularly.[^1]
If it helps you, great! If not, at least I have a bookmark for myself <l> ðŸ˜… </l>

Okay, these programs lean towards psychology and auditory & language sciences. They do not cover many other domains within cognitive science. <a href="mailto:pratikbhandarinp+blog@gmail.com?">Let me know</a> about other better-not-miss conferences, symposia and summer schools.<!-- https://direct.mit.edu/opmi/issue # Note this journal. -->

Among the ones that I have attended, the following summer schools/workshops have been quite helpful:

1.  Summer School on Statistical Methods for Linguistics and Psychology ([SMLP](https://vasishth.github.io/IntroBayesSMLP2021/))
2.  Neuromatch academy ([NMA](https://academy.neuromatch.io))
3.  ...

Happy learning!
