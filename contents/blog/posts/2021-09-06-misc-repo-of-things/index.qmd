<!-- Oh, so some links brought you here. Cool.\ -->

***

I am in the Fifth Summer School on Statistical Methods for Linguistics and Psychology ([SMLP 2021](https://vasishth.github.io/smlp2021/)).
While reading this [textbook](https://vasishth.github.io/bayescogsci/book/) recommended by the summer school instructors,
I realized I needed a refresher on a few mathematical notations, among many other things.
Some of these are on set theory and logical conditionals.

I’ve linked some Wikipedia articles that helped me refresh my high school maths and gain new knowledge. Wanna see?

1.  [Glosarry of mathematical symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_mathematical_symbols)

2.  [Power set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set)

3.  [Domain of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function)

4.  [Codomain of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain)

5.  [Material conditional/material implication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional)

6.  [Predicate (in matematical logic)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(mathematical_logic))

7.  [Limit ordinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_ordinal)

Perhaps, someday in the distant future, I will write about applying these ideas in my work or not. Let’s see.
