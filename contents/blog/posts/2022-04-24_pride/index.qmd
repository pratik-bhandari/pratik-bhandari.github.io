A game started in a lunch among some colleagues. Everyone was to answer a question: 'What are you proud of?'
When my turn came, I was blank.
I really had no anser to that question. It was not a long time ago that I had a long discussion with a frind about identity and pride.
And here I am now, having to answer what holds my pride.
There were plenty of things I could have said I am proud of. But what does it mean to be proud of? 

I believe that pride entails comparison with someone else, something else and holds oneself in a higher sttus, a ghither ground than others.
It means that I consider myself better than someone else.
I am not saying that I don't compare myself with other people, I have not attained spiritual enlightenment;
and I am not presenting the hypocricy.
But climing my pride is claiming my higher status which always is ephemeral.

Depending on the context, pride loosely translates to garva, ghamanda, ahankar, or abhiman.
All these words are derived from Sanskrit.
From my experience of the use of these words in Nepali, I can say that I don't claim to be proud of anything. At least I don't want to be.
I'd like to be away from ghamanda, ahankar and abhman. I am not proud of anything in these three meanings; at least I'd not want to be.

What about 'garva'? This is a gray area. And I'll talk about 'garva' flavor of 'pride' today.

If you'd have asked me 10 years ago, I'd have said I am proud to be an IOMite,
I am proud to be a Nepali (afterall Sagarmatha is in Nepal, and Buddha was born in Nepal),
and so on.
I had no contribution in being a Nepali --- it was a mere chance which part of the world you are born, what your race and ethnicity is, what your surrounding is and so on. This doesn't mean that I don't love my country; but love is not equal to pride.
kasailai maya garnu ra garva garnu eutai kura hoina.
Why sould I hold a pride on studying in the IoM? Those who didn't get into IOM are no less than me; perhaps many of them were better than those at IOM. This IOM pride looks down upon those who couldn't get in, and those who studied elsewhere.
And, now, it is a past. Real life doesn't care IOM.

Should I be proud that despite my health condition, I have made up to where I am today?
I have always been supported by people around me. My journey has not beeen that of a lone ranger.
Family and friends have been with me every step of the waay; at least most of the times.
Being proud here is a bit of survivorship bias, and a bit of ignoring the fact that there are people who have been in worse circumstances than I am and still done great things.
