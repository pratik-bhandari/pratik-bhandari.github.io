After more than 2 years of Zoom and GaterTown, very recently I presented the results of my work in an in-person conference in the Netherlands.
To be more accurate, I traveled to the Netherlands to attend a hybrid conference where I presented a poster in-person.

The conference organizers did a great job in organizing and managing the conference: the program had to be in sync between in-person attendees and online attendees.

Covid has taught us how to integrate 'online' presence with the real life.
The organizers had invited keynote speakers from across the Atlantic from the US who did not attend the conference in-person.
But their keynote speech was presented either by playing a pre-recorded video, or live via Zoom.
Isn't it wonderful!
Not only the attendees don't have to travel to attend the conference, but also the speakers can give their keynote speech via Zoom or even through a pre-recorded video!
Future conferences will be Meta! :wink:

While carefully listening to the keynote speech and invited talks given by the speakers from European and American institutes,
I couldn't help but see the void in the 'research':
There were no speakers from South Asia or South America or Africa for that matter.
Given that the number of keynote speeech and invited talks was limited,
it is understandable that the organizers could not easily include the talks from everyone all over the world.
But is it really that hard to include a presentation of a study from the Global South?
The conference organizers do have 'International' in their name,
but it appeared to be 'European' to a large extent.



While I carefully listened to the keynote speech and the invited talks given both in-person as well as online,
I couldn't help but think about 'who' the speaker is and what 'cognition' are they talking about.
All of them were the resident of Europe or the US; nothing wrong with this!
But are we done with the WEIRD science?

Psychology and neuroscience research is dominated by WEIRD samples.

It was very exciting to listen to the keynote speakers from the US who reportedly could not travel for the conference.

After more than 2 years of online conferences, very recently I've had an opportunity to attend an in-person conference in the Netherlands.
What more, I even presented results of an experiment from my PhD project.

The conference organizers did a splendid job in managing both in-person attendees as well as online attendees:
people presented posters both in-person as well as online; keynote speech was delivered in-person as well as online; and everything was managed pretty much smoothly.

Having attended this hybrid form of conference, I am hopeful that in the future, all the academic conferences will be held in a hybrid format: participants (attendees and speakers alike) will have a choice to attend online or in-person.
