Sci-fi movies have always captivated me, especially those that delve into time travel. Gone are the days when the mere presence of a time travel gadget or a loop day would impress most people.

With a meagre investment of only $7000, Shane Carruth directed and produced the remarkable movie "Primer" (2005), which earned the Grand Jury Prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival.

Unlike a typical time travel flick where the protagonist uses a machine to traverse backward or forward in time or possesses the superpower to navigate past, present, and future, "Primer" offers a unique plot.
Protagonists Aron and Abe discover time travel through a machine they invent, a time box,
which can essentially create at least two versions of the same person.
Aron and Abe exploit the box by making profitable stock trades,
apparently with the success of putting their old selves in the box, quite literally.

<!-- At this point, I already have a question: which is thre real Aron and Abe and why? 
 Does this question sound familiar? Hold on to it. -->

Hold your questions.

In the later days, however, multiple versions of Aron and Abe co-exist.
As a viewer, it becomes harder to discern which ones are the originals.
And this hits the nail on the head.

In any instance of time travel in the movie, when a duplicate of, say, Aron is formed, what is there to say that this iteration's Aron is any less *real* than the "original" Aron?
The duplicate retains all previous memories, experiences, and consciousness, essentially identical.

One of the movie's subtle responses to this question is suggested in the airport scene.
Aron leaves the town, while Abe wishes to remain.
A heated argument ensues regarding what to do about the "problem" of the other originals/duplicates: to leave them be or address the situation.
Perhaps Shane Carruth intended to convey that all duplicates possess their unique identity until their formation, after which new stimuli influence their individuality.

Is this question any different than the Teletransportation paradox?
Without being a philosopher, it seems like “Primer” also grapples with the Teletransportataion paradox,
albeit with a fresh perspective on the issues of identity and consciousness.
Instead of asking if you remain the same person when disassembled here and reformed on Mars,
**“Primer” asks a different question**: if an identical copy of you is created, which one would indeed be you?
To phrase it differently, if you wake up and find a duplicate version of yourself, which of you would be *you*?
All to say, “Primer” also showcases the essence of the Teletransportation problem.

The movie was not a getaway place to find solutions to the philosophical quandaries of the mind, consciousness, and identity.
Sometimes, it’s fun looking outside from someone else’s eyes.
