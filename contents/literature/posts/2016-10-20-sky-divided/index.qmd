They say sky is limitless.\
Lie?\
Ignorance?\
Deception?\
\
Our skies are divided\
by narrow horizons of\
color and creed\
gods and deed\
flags and seat,\
The narrow horizons\
Borne\
Out of the mind.\
\
Every day\
Across these horizons\
I cross the borders\
And walk\
Beyond the territory of human creation.\
Every day\
Someone mightier\
Builds up another wall --\
I hit and fall,\
Everyday,\
I stumble, limp\
And walk again\
Crossing new boundaries.\
\
Will you join me\
To break the walls?\
To across all the limiting horizons?\
And truly say --\
The sky limitless!
