<!-- Oh, so some links brought you here. Cool.\ -->

***

They say there are ups and downs\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*Like a mountain, or a roller coaster?*\
They say life is not a straight line\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*A smooth curve or a sharp saw?*

Short journey:\
started as strangers,\
the two walked as one.\
The ups and downs never tired us.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(*until we got tired of each other*)\
The sharp saw never ripped us apart.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(*until we ripped each other into pieces*)

Here we are,\
completing the loop --\
ended up as strangers.

Congratulations!\
We made a full circle today
