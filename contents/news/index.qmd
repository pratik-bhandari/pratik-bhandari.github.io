* **June 14**: Earlier this month, I attended the [IMPRS conference](https://www.mpi.nl/imprs-conference) at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics at Nijmegen in the Netherlands. I presented a [poster](imprs2022-poster.pdf) discussing the results of the experiments in which we found that a decrease in the speech rate does not amplify the [predictability effect](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.714485/full) in degraded speech comprehension.

* **April 18**: I can't attend the APS convention. Don't get me started about the hectic visa procedure. 2 months notice is not enough, APS! There are similar problems in other conferences organized in the USA. People have tweeted about it. See [this](https://twitter.com/ProfSomashekhar/status/1509430243412496388?s=20&t=hIB7IwHWHlxVPeDTlIXsew),

[this](https://twitter.com/bkhmsi/status/1504954744250372096?s=20&t=hIB7IwHWHlxVPeDTlIXsew),
for example.
Do you see a pattern? Humans are pattern seeking (and finding) animals collectively as a nation too.

* **April 14**: Our work on *the effect of speech rate on degraded speech comprehension* has been accepted for poster presentation at the IMPRS Conference [2022](https://www.mpi.nl/imprs-conference) to be held at MPI Psycholinguistics (Nijmegen, Netherlands) in June 01-03. A manuscript is cooking as well [;](bhandari2022speechrate.pdf))

* **March 09**: Our work on *the role of attention on degraded speech comprehension* has been accepted for poster presentation at the APS Annual Convention [2022](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/conventions/2022-aps-annual-convention) in Chicago in May 26-29.
