As of 23 May, in a country of 30 million people, more than 513 thousand have lost their lives to covid^[Data from [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/nepal/#graph-deaths-daily)].
Daily deaths, active cases and daily new cases are all increasing very rapidly; everything seems out of control! Many covid-related deaths are due to the lack of oxygen supply, ventilators, critical care units, human resources, and just hospital beds.
Once a patient dies, another one gets the bed. I can't begin to imagine what it must be like to the patients and their families, the doctors and nurses triaging life and death. Those ambulance drivers whose ambulance is on a hold because there's a patient in there waiting for a bed in a hospital while the driver gets a call from another family asking to rush another patient to the hospital. God forbid, at the end, if both the patients were to die without reaching the hospital...

With its limited resources and the ongoing suicidal political games, the government is failing to deliver emergency medical supplies and vaccines. Nevertheless, our prime minister has recently pledged for help from the UK and other G7 nations^[Opinion piece by Nepal's prime minister KP Sharma Oli in the [Guradian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/10/nepal-covid-uk-g7)].
Yesterday, the UN has [appealed](https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/un-appeals-funds-help-nepal-deal-covid-19) to the international community to provide aid to Nepal to overcome this humanitarian crisis.
Countries like Switzerland^[[Press release](https://www.eda.admin.ch/countries/nepal/en/home/news/news.html/content/countries/nepal/en/meta/news/2021/5/20210522) by Swiss government] and China have sent some supplies but it is not enough. Nepalis living abroad are collecting funds to buy oxygen concentrators and oxygen cylinders and are sending them home.
While the effort is rightfully on oxygen supply, another important aspect of covid control is overlooked.\
[Dr. Anup Subedee](https://twitter.com/AnupSubedee), a medical doctor and an infectious disease expert in [Nepal](https://hamshospital.com/doctor/dr-anup-subedee-2/) has recently written about it on Twitter in response to questions about how people outside Nepal can help.
Below is a part of his [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/AnupSubedee/status/1393774841044488192?s=20).

- There's too little happening in terms of public health response to the pandemic surge- **test/trace/isolate & quarantine/vaccinate** – the only interventions that can reduce the number of new cases in community... Since there is no system to intervene in the community, we'll be back in square one as soon as we loosen the lockdown.
- Currently the test positivity rates are around 45% nationally --> the real number of daily new cases is many times higher than the reported numbers. **People are not getting tested because of lack of kits** in towns and villages and border checkpoints.
- **If we were to invest primarily in testing** – antigen and PCR kits, **many more positive cases will be identified**.
- Cool thing about testing: **testing alone will help drive some level of contact tracing**, isolation and quarantine without the state’s intervention. Once you identify someone as positive, they tend to self-isolate, try to protect dear ones, & neighbors will be more careful.
- **Pathway for such testing drive**:
Symptoms present-> antigen test. Ag test positive-> treat as COVID case. Ag test negative-> send PCR swab and isolate.
Asymptomatic, exposed to someone with COVID-> PCR test after quarantine period
- <b> <u> While some are working on immediate priorities like oxygen supply,
others should think about how they can help to mitigate the pandemic spreading like wildfire in the community.
Let's help run these massive test campaigns that are so acutely needed in our communities </u> </b>.

Now the question is how can you send the test kits to Nepal? All the international flights to Nepal are closed. Only cargo flights are operational. I see there are two options available:

1. Send funds directly to an NGO/INGO, or a government agency who can buy the testing kits.

2. Buy the kits and send them to Nepal.


For example, Non-Residential Nepali Association, Germany is [raising funds](https://www.gofundme.com/f/purchase-oxygen-concentrators-for-nepalcovid19?utm_campaign=p_cp_display&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer) to buy oxygen-concentrators and send them directly to Nepal in coordination with the embassies. This seems like a good model.

Whichever options you choose, it is better to collaborate with like-minded people, i.e., those who want to save Nepali lives, and coordinate with the country's government and Nepal Embassy. I am hopeful this approach will work out. If you have other faster ways of delivery, do comment below so that we can collaborate.

Along with this, you can also support organizations like [Health foundation Nepal](https://www.facebook.com/donate/784739402408646/784770652405521/) that is running psychological counseling and telemedicine for covid patients.

Again, we need oxygen; we also need testing kits.


**Gotta rush. Our small effort can help save lives!!**
