<!-- Oh, so some links brought you here. Cool.\ -->

While attending the Fifth Summer School on Statistical Methods for Linguistics and Psychology ([SMLP 2021](https://vasishth.github.io/smlp2021/)), and reading this [textbook](https://vasishth.github.io/bayescogsci/book/) recommended by the instructors of the summer school, I realized that I needed a refresher on some mathematical notations among many other things. Some of them were on set theory and logical conditionals.

I've put together links to some wikipedia articles that helped me refresh my high school maths, and gain some new knowledge. Wanna see?

1.  [Glosarry of mathematical symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_mathematical_symbols)

2.  [Power set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set)

3.  [Domain of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function)

4.  [Codomain of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain)

5.  [Material conditional/material implication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional)

6.  [Predicate (in matematical logic)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(mathematical_logic))

7.  [Limit ordinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_ordinal)

Perhaps, some day in a distant future, I will write about applying these ideas in my work, or not. Let's see.
