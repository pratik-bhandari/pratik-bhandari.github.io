"PhD students **should not** work on weekends." -- This is discussed, or rather argued over frequently on Twitter. Recently, this came up in a graduate students' meetup at [SFB, UdS](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/contact/members/). People tend to have polar opposite views on this topic. There are a couple of underlying assumptions that slide in to these debates:\
    -   PhD is just a job.
    -   PhD is more than a job.

Technically, PhD is a job here in Germany. (Let's talk about the exceptions in a while.) But this job comes as a fixed term contract -- for 3 years, with approx. 40 working hours per week. Do you expect people to finish a PhD in 3 years working 40 hours a week? If yes, then I surely am an imposter here. One does not **have to** work on weekends but you can't get things done if you do not work everyday.\
This does not mean that I spend all my waking hours *working*, whatever that means. The best thing about my *job* is that my supervisors don't micromanage my work; as long as we are on the same page and things are progressing, it is fine with them how I get things done, and where from. I did home office even before covid. Sorry, I digress.
There are weekdays when I can't work. What do I do? I just leave the day as a 'leave'. I can extend my week to Saturday, or Sunday.\
For people like me who have left their *home* and *family* for only one purpose, there is only one thing top on the priority list -- get the shit done. We are here for research; this is the family that we have. And it is all that matters. So weekend or weekdays, giving time to this *job* is what we do.^[There are hundreds of other folks who disagree with me, and might not like me using the word *we*. Don't sweat!]
