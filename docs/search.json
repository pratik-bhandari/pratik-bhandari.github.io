This is going to be a remarkable experience contributing to next year‚Äôs study materials. What aspects should we focus on or correct based on the experience from 2023? Your feedback would be greatly appreciated.\nOctober 03: Our team of enthusiastic researchers, who initially met at the CMA 2023 course (see below), applied for the Climatematch Impact Scholars Program (CISP) and were granted scholarships. Over the next two months, we will be studying the ‚ÄúImpact of Deforestation and Multi-year Cyclical Processes on Precipitation Patterns and Cereal Production in Congo River Basin‚Äù Our goal is to produce at least one paper and a presentation.\nAugust 13: I participated in the ‚ÄúComputational Tools in Climate Science‚Äù course organized by Climatematch Academy from July 17 to 28. The coursework was intense. It was a great opportunity to learn about climate science and computational modelling and meet wonderful people. We worked on a project analysing the relationship between vegetation and the change in precipitation across the Congo River Basin over the past 40+ years.\nFebruary 21: I gave a short talk on the topic ‚ÄúWhat does my post-defence hingsight of 20/20 say? If I were to advise myself‚Ä¶‚Äù to an audience of PhD students on the PhD day organized by the Collaborative Research Center, Saarland University on 09.02.2022. The slides are available here. The talk was based on this blog post.\n\n2022:\n\nDecember 19: I successfully defended my thesis on December 7, and passed magna cum laude. Now I am in the job market!  Get in touch:  work@pratikb.com.\nNovember 10: I submitted my dissertation to the 5-member thesis committee a few weeks ago. The defense will very likely be held on 7 December.\n\nJuly 24: I will present two posters at the Architectures and Mechanisms for Language Processing (AMLaP) conference. It‚Äôll take place in York, England, September 7-9. One poster is about the recent publication on attention-prediction interplay. The second one is about the role of speech rate in the interaction of top-down and bottom-up processes in degraded speech comprehension.\nJuly 22: Our paper on the role of attention to context in understanding degraded speech is published in Language and Cognition. Cheers!\nJune 14: Earlier this month, I attended the IMPRS conference at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics at Nijmegen in the Netherlands. I presented a poster discussing the results of the experiments in which we found that a decrease in the speech rate does not amplify the predictability effect in degraded speech comprehension.\nApril 14: Our work on the effect of speech rate on degraded speech comprehension has been accepted for poster presentation at the IMPRS Conference 2022 to be held at MPI Psycholinguistics (Nijmegen, Netherlands) in June 01-03. A manuscript is cooking as well ;)\nMarch 09: Our work on the role of attention on degraded speech comprehension has been accepted for poster presentation at the APS Annual Convention 2022 in Chicago in May 26-29."

    "text": "I was first introduced to the formal practice of meditation when I was in lower secondary school. After that, there were many instances of following spiritual schools and gurus for the sake of learning how to meditate. It was never consistent, and I was never consistent. In the past few months, I have consistently meditated just by myself. Without a teacher, however, learning the skill of meditation is not an easy task to undertake. After weighing the pros and cons, I decided to learn from a teacher who is trained and knows better and can teach. I came across this app by Sam Harris in which there are different courses and routes of meditation practice, including one for beginners. [Sam is generally known for his expression on politics, philosophy, and religion. But this is not my concern at the moment.] Today marks the 25th day of my regular practice of following a guided meditation. I would recommend it to anyone. With the practice, I have begun to realize those aspects of ‚Äòmyself‚Äô that had gone unnoticed earlier or had been noticed in readings. I have questions about life and existence, about self and consciousness, more than ever before. Probably this also depends on what one seeks from meditation. Why do you (want to) meditate? Do you think that meditation is the remedy to all the problems in your life: stress, negative emotions, anger, and so on? Maybe this is not the right approach to meditation, I opine. I definitely do not qualify to make a seasoned claim. But gleaning what I have glimpsed recently and what I had learnt from my intermittent practice in the past is that meditation is not the means to attain those ends. Meditation, I think, is about being mindful of the existence ‚Äî the existence of thoughts, emotions, feelings, and sensations in one‚Äôs conscious awareness. Realizing and observing that everything we experience in our waking hours (probably while we sleep too) is merely the appearance of those experiences in the field of conscious awareness. And we identify this experience as ‚Äòself‚Äô, an illusory self. This realization, even if momentary in the beginning, is enlightening [I am not using the word ‚Äòenlightening‚Äô in the same sense used in different Buddhist and Hindu traditions.] I can‚Äôt say for sure if I am under an illusion that I have glimpsed it: there are instances during meditation when I have momentarily observed the non-existence of ‚Äòself‚Äô; there is no ‚ÄòI‚Äô. This might as well be an illusion in the end. With time and practice, things will be clearer for me. After all, you can see how often the word ‚ÄòI‚Äô has been used in this writing ‚Äî the self is extremely dominant. And semantics does matter, doesn‚Äôt it?\nSignup to my newsletter for updates."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A couple of days ago, our paper on the role of attention in the facilitatory effect of predictability in the comprehension of degraded speech was published in Language and Cognition.\nIn an earlier paper published in the section Auditory Cognitive Neuroscience of Frontiers in Psychology, we had shown that listeners utilize context in a sentence that facilitates their comprehension of a degraded speech. Say, in a high predictability sentence like, ‚ÄúShe dribbles the ball‚Äù, identification of ‚Äúball‚Äù is facilitated by its preceding context compared to a low predictability sentence like, ‚ÄúShe buys a ball‚Äù. This Language and Cognition paper shows that such facilitation is possible only when listeners pay attention to the sentence context and process it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one experiment, we asked participants to listen to a degraded speech and report only the final word of a sentence they heard. It restricted their attention to the target word at the sentence-final position (e.g., ‚Äúball‚Äù). In another experiment, they were asked to report the entire sentence. This task did not restrict their attention to any part of the sentence; they could attend to the sentence context that preceded the target word. The results showed that the effect of predictability‚Äîa significant difference in the accuracy of recognition of the words like ‚Äúball‚Äù between high and low predictability sentences‚Äîwas observed only in the second case when the participants reported the entire sentence. While reporting only the final word, there was no such effect of predictability.\nOur findings suggest that when they report only the sentence-final target word, listeners‚Äô attention is restricted to a particular time point as the speech unfolds in time. They do not process the context information that precedes the target word. Hence, there was no effect of predictability. On the contrary, while reporting the entire sentence, they also attend to the sentence context. They process the context information forming predictions about upcoming linguistic units; in this case, the prediction is about the sentence-final target word. Accuracy is lower for words that are less predictable from the context than those that are more predictable from the context.\nAll in all, our findings show that prediction in language processing is not an automatic process. Especially in an adverse listening condition, listeners have to attend to the context information to get any benefit from the context. In other words, attention is a prerequisite to processing context information and generating linguistic predictions.\nAttention is all you need. Not all, but something you need to start with.\nSignup to my newsletter for updates."

    "text": "Sci-fi movies have always captivated me, especially those that delve into time travel. Gone are the days when the mere presence of a time travel gadget or a loop day would impress most people.\nWith a meagre investment of only $7000, Shane Carruth directed and produced the remarkable movie ‚ÄúPrimer‚Äù (2005), which earned the Grand Jury Prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival.\nUnlike a typical time travel flick where the protagonist uses a machine to traverse backwards or forward in time or possesses the superpower to navigate past, present, and future, ‚ÄúPrimer‚Äù offers a unique plot. Protagonists Aron and Abe discover time travel through the machine they invent, a time box, which essentially creates at least two versions of the same person. Aron and Abe exploit the box by making profitable stock trades, apparently with the success of putting their old selves in the box, quite literally.\n\n\n\nMethod of timetravel in Primer\n\n\nBy derivative work: Tom-b (talk)Time_Travel_Method.jpg: Original uploader was William lee0 at en.wikipedia - Time_Travel_Method, CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nHold your thoughts.\nMultiple versions of Aron and Abe co-exist in the later days. As a viewer, it becomes harder to discern which pair is the original. And this hits the nail on the head of the entire time-travel enterprise of the movie for us.\nSay that in an instance of time travel in the movie, a duplicate of Aron is formed. What is there to say that this iteration‚Äôs Aron is less real than the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù Aron? The duplicate retains all previous memories, experiences, and consciousness; all iterations are essentially identical!\n\n\n\n\n¬© Pratik Bhandari, CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\n\nThe movie‚Äôs subtle response to this, among many questions, is suggested in the airport scene. Aron leaves the town, while Abe wishes to remain. A heated argument ensues regarding what to do about the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù of the other originals/duplicates: to leave them be or address the situation. Perhaps Shane Carruth intended to convey that all duplicates possess their unique identity until their formation, after which new stimuli influence their individuality. They are free to take different, independent roads.\nIs this question pointed out above any different than the Teletransportation paradox? Without being a philosopher, it seems like ‚ÄúPrimer‚Äù also grapples with the Teletransportataion paradox, albeit with a fresh perspective on the issues of identity and consciousness. Instead of asking if you remain the same person when disassembled here and reformed on Mars atom by atom, ‚ÄúPrimer‚Äù asks a different question. If an identical copy of ‚Äúyou‚Äù is created, which one is the real you? To phrase it differently, if you wake up and find a duplicate version of yourself, which of you would be you? All to say, ‚ÄúPrimer‚Äù also showcases a different face of the Teletransportation paradox.\nMovies may not be the getaway place to find solutions to the philosophical quandaries of the mind, consciousness, and identity. But sometimes, it is ‚Äúfun‚Äù looking out from someone else‚Äôs artistic lens. Expands your horizon. The problem of consciousness may not be solved in the next twenty-five years. But ‚Äúidentity‚Äù? It is more than an academic estimation to bet on a bottle of wine. Identity extends beyond personal, national, and second person observation in behavioural sciences. We will try to talk about these them next time, hopefully with some experts. Aren‚Äôt we all experts in a way, after all?\nThoughts? Get in touch.\n\n\nSignup to my newsletter for updates."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In a dimly lit room, I am in a bed surrounded by green people: green gowns and green masks. They talk gibberish. I understand a few words: Maya, female, 28, chest, anaesthesia, Glassman, hour. They are preparing me and waiting for Dr Glassman to arrive.\n‚ÄúMy name is Nurse Mark. You are in the operation room. Do you understand, Miss Maya?‚Äù I nod my head. He seems to not understand. I say, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He smiles. He moves me under two giant inverted-umbrella-like monsters. They look like a constellation of LED lights you often see in Gray‚Äôs Anatomy. Suddenly they glow, and my eyes are blinded for a moment. Dr Glassman is here.\n‚ÄúHello, Maya! How are you doing?‚Äù\n‚ÄúOkay. Waiting it to start and get over with. You are using local, right?‚Äù\n‚ÄúGood then. You didn‚Äôt want general. So.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve already experienced your general anesthesia. This time I want to be awake the whole time. I want to see you operate on me. I mean, how it works.‚Äù\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if you can see. You know that there will be a drape.‚Äù\nOh crap. I‚Äôd forgotten about the drape. They hide my head.\n‚ÄúOh.‚Äù\n\nHe moves the surgical display monitor here and there. (This is fancy!) I can see my chest on it. Reminds of Dashain when after beheading a goat, men in the village would shave it off and apply turmeric powder on its body before cutting it into pieces. Betadine had made my chest look just like the goat‚Äôs yellow stomach. I still have my head intact, and Dr Glassman is not Frankenstein.\nMark arranges the drapes around me. The monitor is hidden now. All I see is Green. Anaesthesia is already doing its job ‚Äì I can no longer feel my chest. A guy comes near my ear and says, ‚ÄúYou will feel dizzy and a bit cold. I have given a medication.‚Äù I read his name: ‚ÄúDr Truman, Anaesthesia‚Äù. I chuckle. Mark had opened an IV line for him in my left arm.\nWait! Didn‚Äôt Dr Glassman just say local anaesthesia? Why would I feel dizzy? Did Truman just say I won‚Äôt be able to move? How will I breathe then? They had already put an oxygen tube in and around my nose. Am I duped into all this? God.\nMy head! It‚Äôs hurting now. I feel tired. Sleepy. Why are my eyelids closing? I don‚Äôt want to sleep. I just want to experience everything that happens during the operation. I am here also to remind Dr Glassman to take pictures. (He has an iPhone, better than mine.) MRI images do not satisfy the eagerness of human eyes. A piece of paper with numbers on it does not give you a complete picture. Doctors might form an image out of it, but I have to see the thing itself. Don‚Äôt you wish to see the face of your killer before he is sentenced to death? Just that you don‚Äôt survive the murder attempt, and death sentences are either not possible or are not real solutions. Still, the wish remains. Sorry, I went a bit emotional. Philosophical.\nStruggling not to close the eyelids, I ask Dr Glassman how it is going there. He doesn‚Äôt say a thing. Loud. ‚ÄúHey Doctor. I don‚Äôt want to sleep. I will sing songs. Is that okay?‚Äù\n‚ÄúHmm‚Äù\nI don‚Äôt know if he is talking to me or saying something to the other assisting doctor.\nI don‚Äôt care. I can‚Äôt care. I first go with Nabin K Bhattarai: ‚ÄúKhadai nakhako bish le jyudai maryo‚Äù. Then some of Coldplay, I think. English, Nepali, Hindi all mixed up ‚Äì my frustrations are spelt out then: ‚ÄòFuck‚Äô, ‚ÄòMuji‚Äô, ‚ÄòMadarchod‚Äô, ‚Ä¶ Some ill-formed sentences to some loving motherfuckers. I get them all out. Everyone here has their own shit to care about to make the operation successful despite my practice for the audition of Nepal Idol and Himalaya Roadies.\nBreathing is getting difficult. Someone is stabbing me. My chest hurts. I turn left ‚Äì the clock says 3:30. Does the anaesthesia wear off after 1 hour? When did they give the anaesthesia? It is all because I resisted sleep. People say sleep is essential. Or maybe I just dozed off due to the anaesthesia, and this is a dream. I will wake up without any pain. But what about this pain right now? Remember what Descartes said: what you feel is real. Did he really say that? Fuck Descartes. He never experienced anaesthesia. Screw all armchair philosophers who don‚Äôt have any experience of altered consciousness.\n\nAhhh!!! No!!! Needles on my chest. Is Dr Glassman already sewing? I clench my fist with every penetration of the needle. ‚ÄúWow, the surgery was short!‚Äù Nothing. Louder. ‚ÄúNo.¬†It hurts!‚Äù Nothing. Don‚Äôt they hear me? Am I just speaking inside my head? Or am I just paralyzed? I‚Äôll be one of those stories of patients awake during surgeries feeling all the pain but unable to speak.\nI am in pain now. The pain is getting unbearable. In despair, minutes feel like an eternity. When the pain is beyond ‚Äòunbearable‚Äô, the concept of time evaporates into the ether. It is just pain and you.\n‚ÄúCongratulations! We have removed the tumor.‚Äù Dr Glassman removes the drape and winks with his usual ‚ÄúCancer is canceled.‚Äù\nI look down where my breast used to be. Sure, ‚ÄòCancer is cancelled.‚Äô\n\nSignup to my newsletter for updates."

    "text": "These are some works I have undertaken in the past few years.\n\nLanguage Comprehension in a Noisy Channel\nI was a part of project A4 at the Collaborative Research Center (SFB 1102) Information Density and Linguistic Encoding at Saarland University. The project aims to ‚Äòexamine how noise (or the effect of reduced hearing ability) will influence language comprehension, and how natural language generation systems can adapt their output to minimize the risk of misunderstanding‚Äô. With Prof.¬†Vera Demberg, Prof.¬†Jutta Kray and Prof.¬†Dietrich Klakow as the PIs of the project, I investigated behavioural and neural correlates of the interaction between top-down predictive language processing and bottom-up auditory perceptual processing and how ‚Äònoise in the signal‚Äô interacts with these functions. This project also contributed to my doctoral research (Nov 2018-Jan 2023).\n\n\nCOVIDiSTRESS global survey\nI was a part of an international consortium of researchers who gathered together to collect data on people‚Äôs psychological response to covid-19 pandemic in 48 countries. The study conducted by this consortium investigated the differences in responses across countries and cultures, and the impact of these differences in people‚Äôs behavior, their coping and trust in governments‚Äô preventive measures. A couple of findings of this very early study were: Those who were most concerned over the virus trusted the government measures where the policies were strict; and one of the primary factors that contributed to mental distress was the concern over a disease. There were within and between country variations, undoubtedly.\n\n\nPredictability in Bilingual Language Processing\nI conducted a research project to investigate the effect of predictability on semantic processing and metacognitive processing in Spanish-Basque bilinguals during my Master in Cognitive Neuroscience of Language at the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language (Sep 2017-Sep 2018). In 2 experiments, I found that predictability enhanced semantic and metacognitive processing in Basque (low proficiency language) when Basque words were presented as predictable trials. Such an effect of predictability was absent in Spanish (high proficiency language). This research project resulted in my Master‚Äôs thesis, supervised by Prof.¬†David Soto.\n\n\nExecutive Control in Bilinguals\nI was involved in several research projects as a research intern at Prof.¬†Ramesh Kumar Mishra‚Äôs Action Control and Cognition Lab at the Center for Neural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Hyderabad, India (Dec 2015-May 2017).\n\nSensitivity to Contextual Factors\nIn this research, we examined bilinguals‚Äô sensitivity to social-conversational context: if the presence of interlocutors modulates their executive control. We found that compared to low proficient bilinguals, high proficient bilinguals bring in higher executive control when the context demands higher monitoring due to the presence of diverse interlocutors (i.e., those who differ in their language profile) randomly.\n\n\nLanguage Proficiency and Aging\nThis research examined if second language proficiency modulates executive control in older adults. We found that there was no bilingual advantage: second language proficiency did not have any effect on executive control measures in older Telugu-English bilinguals.\n\n\n\nNeurodiversity\nI was a speech-language pathologist for over four years in Nepal: a student clinician for over three years, a clinical intern for a year, and then some months of independent practice. Based on these experiences and my personal experience with autism, I expressed concern with my co-author Mr Pratik Khanal, a public health expert, regarding the potential side effects of the ‚Äúno cure‚Äù advocacy in correspondence to a Lancet editorial. We argue that ‚Äúno cure‚Äù could hinder care to those in need, especially in countries where health care resources are poor and the available resources are poorly distributed.\n\n\nHere you can find a list of all my publications, talks, and presentations relevant to these projects."

    "section": "Pre-defence",
    "text": "Pre-defence\n\nWorries\nWorry and nervousness were fluctuating. Three weeks before the defence, I was slightly anxious. It subsided the following week. The week before the defence, I started to become nervous. Many questions occupied my mind. What if I can‚Äôt answer committee members‚Äô questions in front of so many people? (What if no one attends?) What if they ask questions referring to a specific page number and sentence? Can I defend each sentence while everyone watches me? What if I fumble too much, which I tend to do when nervous? What if I can‚Äôt answer the questions? What if my answers do not satisfy them? Will I and my presentation be clear and understandable to those committee members who are not remotely close to language sciences, let alone my specific line of work? Should I ask my parents and friends not to come to the defence because it would be humiliating and embarrassing for everyone?\nOkay. I let you into my secret and darkest thoughts. Read further. Now, what next?\nI was having trouble finding a room with a hybrid ‚Äî online and in-person ‚Äî facility. Any room with such functionality was already booked for the day. Somehow, I got a room in the middle of the forest, away from the centre of the university. It was worrisome that the online system did not work on the first try. It took two days to make it work: There was no IT support. It is ridiculous that the student has to organize everything for their defence, and the University does not do it as far as I know.\nThere is a tradition of serving food and drink on the day of defence after the defence is over. I had to plan what to bring and where from. It is quite simple, but amid the nervousness about the defence (presentation and Q&A), it became a big deal. Not everything was as bad as it sounds here, or that it can‚Äôt be overcome1."

    "section": "The defence",
    "text": "The defence\nLet‚Äôs talk about the defence: my presentation and the Q&A session. I was allocated 30 minutes to talk about four years of research. It was followed by an hour-long Q&A session. In that hour, the committee members asked plenty of questions, some expected and some unexpected. (One committee member, who was in Saarbr√ºcken, didn‚Äôt attend in person. I assumed he would; I never asked.) At that time, I couldn‚Äôt have guessed how long the Q&A had lasted: It neither felt like an eternity nor did it feel like a blink of an eye.\n\nPresentation\nI had my notes for the PowerPoint presentation in the speaker notes. Trying to peek at it was distracting at times: Such was not the case in the earlier practice talks I had given in front of my colleagues and friends. The microphones on the podium were very distracting in the presentation. I felt like I had to hear my voice from the overhead loudspeakers; otherwise, the audience wouldn‚Äôt hear me. But I realised later that it wasn‚Äôt the case. The online audience could hear me via the ‚Äúroom mic‚Äù placed near me. The in-person audience could have heard me even without the loudspeakers.\nI also lost my train of thought at least three points throughout the presentation, which means I likely said something random to get back on track. (Later people in the audience reported that they didn‚Äôt notice anything like that. Well, I guess they were being polite to me. After all, I had already passed when I asked if they‚Äôd noticed me lose focus.) I‚Äôm saying now that I couldn‚Äôt deliver everything as I‚Äôd planned then.\n\n\nThe Q&A round\nThe word ‚Äúdefence‚Äù makes it sound as if someone is attacking you, and you are protecting yourself from the attack. We are programmed to feel that way from the time when we learn about dissertation, thesis, passing PhD, and ‚Ä¶defence. Okay, so how did it go in my case? Not as bad as I had imagined the worse case scenario to be. It went well. Some questions were anticipated, some not, and some: I had no clue how to answer. I believe all questions of different flavours are asked to test how a ‚Äúdefendant‚Äù responds in an intellectual/academic discussion. You should be ready to answer, or at least respond, to everything, sensibly. Is that what we get evaluated on? I digress.\nIn general, I felt I could have answered many questions better than how and what I did. Good thing: I waited to reply after the question was asked. Didn‚Äôt rush. Most of the time, I took some time to think through the questions, and sketched in a notepad what the answers could be. Then I responded. This approach was very beneficial when the questions were tricky and unanticipated and when I had never before looked at my studies from a particular point of view raised by the committee members. I heard that some audience members didn‚Äôt like me ‚Äúwriting something‚Äù before answering the question, as if I was ‚Äúwriting a book‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know what the committee members thought. And I don‚Äôt remember clearly if I even mentioned to the committee what I was doing. Maybe I didn‚Äôt. A mistake?\nThe difficult and a bit problematic part was coordinating between online and in-person committee members when they were asking questions. In principle, it is the committee Chair‚Äôs job to manage and organise who asks questions and for how long. But the mic in the room didn‚Äôt pick up the Chair‚Äôs voice, so I had to reiterate what he said to the online committee members. It could have been smoother than it was, had everyone been present in person. I could not pay attentiontion to the online audience, my friends and families, after the presentation when I (and everyone in the room) was asked to leave the room for the committee members to decide the fate of my PhD."

    "section": "What am I preaching here?",
    "text": "What am I preaching here?\n(C‚Äômon, don‚Äôt take it literally. I am not preaching!)\nThe committee called me in after some minutes. There were some secret vows I had to make to obtain doctoral degree :P (Nothing like that.) They told I passed with good grades :) Felt happy for some minutes; don‚Äôt ask what the feeling was after those fleeting moments. With the benefit of hindsight, all the worries and nervousness and anxiety seem to be too intense than they could have been should have been. It is natural and maybe necessary to be worried to some extent, but not too much. Having said that, if I travelled back in time before the defence and told myself not to worry so much, I doubt I would be any less worried or anxious.\nI saved myself some trouble by taking advice from those who had gone through a similar phase before me. There are also plenty of instances where I could still have done better. Based on others‚Äô and my experiences, I would recommend the following, in no particular order, to someone who plans to defend their thesis:\n\nDo as many dry runs as possible. Present it to your lab members; get the bad news at home. Also, present it to people who are not very familiar with your work. Get input from a wider variety of audiences if your committee members have a diverse set of expertise.\nPrepare a script for what you‚Äôd want to say on each slide. Time your talk about being within the given time (30 minutes in most of the departments in UdS).\nConfirm with all committee members a day before the defence if they are attending regardless of the nature of the defence (in-person, online, or hybrid). There may be last-minute changes in their plans, and you might not get the information on time.\nTest everything a couple of days ahead of the day of defence. Make sure that all the instruments and IT equipment are functional. And on the day of defence, carry a spare laptop, just in case your laptop decides to give up on you.\n\nIt is better to do a dry run in the venue if possible. Find and remove or manage distracting objects. The microphone was unexpectedly distracting in my case.\n\nThe committee members are not there to attack you, as the word ‚Äúdefense‚Äù implies. They will test you, I think. But have an attitude of an academic/intellectual discussant.\nTry not to drain yourself with too much worry, anxiety, and nervousness. You know better than anyone else in the room about the content of the dissertation, the presentation, and the field of research2: go with this confidence with point 5 in mind.\n\nEliminate unnecessary sources of worries. Food and drinks are not primary concerns. They are manageable. Don‚Äôt put too much thought into them. Just get the damn wine and some cookies or cake or whatever. People aren‚Äôt there for food and drink. If you are like me, you‚Äôd have this conflict: ‚ÄúDown with the culture of PhD students serving food‚Äù vs ‚ÄúAttendees are my guests‚Äù. So, keep a balance. I repeat, direct your worries and concerns to their appropriate place.\nFinding a venue can be daunting. Try to get a place as soon as you have a date fixed. Writing emails to different department secretariats and room managers, waiting for their replies only to know that the rooms are booked, checking online room portals to find out that the rooms aren‚Äôt available on the date of your defence, the contact person of the room that is available is out of office‚Ä¶ This is another source of avoidable worry and stress which can be managed.\n\nSleep, eat, and hydrate. Sleep well before the day of defence. If I were to do it again, I‚Äôd still organize the program in the morning, maybe at 9 and not 8. It saves hours and hours of anticipatory anxiety. You know your body; eat accordingly. Most importantly, don‚Äôt forget to take a bottle and a glass of water with you in the podium or stage. The 90-plus minutes of speaking dries your mouth, and you need hydration anyway. Sipping water also gives some time to organize your thoughts before responding to questions.\nYou don‚Äôt have answers to all questions, especially the ones you did not anticipate and those that come from the point of view you had never considered before. It is okay not to know the exact answer to some questions. But, speculate. Formulate your speculation based on your data and results and the literature.\nGet to know your committee members: their papers, other committees they have been in, the questions they tend to ask, and how kind they are3. Knowing your committee‚Äôs expertise, where they come from, and where they take you with their questions will help you anticipate some questions and prepare accordingly. For example, someone might focus more on experimental methods, while another member might focus on theoritical part of your research.\nRead. Make sure your dissertation is fresh in your mind while you are presenting and answering questions. It is tempting to think that you know what you‚Äôve written. Of course you know. But do you know what statements could stand out as peculiar to the committee, to a reviewer who reads your dissertation? Be safe, do not falter while answering questions pertaining to such peculiarities. So, read. Side benefit: you‚Äôll freshen up the citations in your memory.\n\nThere is always a next thing to do. A new thing to worry about. I passed PhD, and now I‚Äôm worrying about getting a postdoc position of my fit/choice. In hindsight, as time passes, what you accomplished doesn‚Äôt seem too big of a deal, past worries seem too exaggerated. But in the moment, the best thing to do is to manage the concerns and try to perform well. If you are preparing for a PhD defence, I wish you all the best!\nUpdate: I gave a brief presentation on this topic at Saarland University on 09.02.2023.

    "text": "To leave or not to leave (Photo credit: Plagiarised by DALL¬∑E 2)\n\n\nA poignant scene from Interstellar shows an unfolding of heartache between Murph and Cooper:\n\nMurph: You have no idea when you‚Äôre coming back. No idea at all!\nMurph throws the watch and turns her back.\nCooper: Don‚Äôt make leave like this, Murph. Please. I have to go now.\nMurph will not turn around. Cooper tries to rest his hand on the back of her head, but she shakes it off.\n\nThis exchange between a departing father and his reluctant daughter strikes a chord reminding me of my own predicament.\nFor almost fifteen years, I have been living far from home. There is no set timetable for a return visit to spend time with my family. No schedule is ever fixed. And whenever I am home, I depart without knowing when I‚Äôll be back again. Just like Cooper, my returns are uncertain. And just like Murph, my family knows it very well. I can‚Äôt look in their tearful eyes when I leave. Else, I‚Äôd have said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make me leave like this‚Äù.\nMaybe that‚Äôs why this scene got me in tears.\nWhen you are away from home, time runs differently. You become a ghost. New people don‚Äôt know you, old ones have a faint memory of your existence. You live in a new dimension. Friends become strangers, and strangers become friends.\nWhat happens when I return? Sometimes I feel like I never left. Everything appears fresh and unchanged. Yet, many a time, I feel I‚Äôve returned after spending an eternity in a strange world. I witness what I did not witness, things I missed: funerals unattended, weddings uncelebrated. New kids in the neighbourhood. New houses erected with new families, new faces. I ask where the old ones are. People die, migrate, and move on ‚Äì much like me. To some, I‚Äôm the newcomer; they are newcomers to me. I claim, without voicing, that the place belongs to me, my childhood and my memory. Being new means a never-ending cycle of introductions and re-introductions. Names and faces unpair when you don‚Äôt see or talk with someone for many years. This unpairing always gives a sense of being a stranger. I have not yet gotten used to being new, being a stranger in my own place. Attachment is cruel.\nReality comes and bites you. Continents away, you witness your parents‚Äô ageing and ailing health from a distance. As a parent, maybe they wished to see their child grow up. As a child, I don‚Äôt want my parents to grow old and fragile ‚Äì youthful yearning. Nature takes its course: Every time I go home, I see my parents getting older and older. I can‚Äôt do anything about it while they are declining. It is painful ‚Äì not being there with the people I love while perceiving a rapid advance of their time. Technology will only take you so far.\nThere is a trade-off in living away from home. In a developed country, working a white-colour job, some aspects of life are ostensibly better than back at home. Your priorities determine what pain you are willing to tolerate. Time and again, one has to revisit and reevaluate the priorities‚Ä¶ and take off‚Ä¶ a fresh start.\nSignup to my newsletter for updates."

    "text": "Fig.1 - Schematic representation of waveforms of different speech rates of clean speech. Taken from Lerner et al., 2014\n\n\n\nIn previous studies, we found that at a moderate level of speech degradation, listeners use context information that they attend to and use it to form predictions about the word that comes next in a sentence.\nLet‚Äôs take a very simplified example. Imagine you are speaking to someone over a cellphone, and the signal is poor, which distorts the speech that you hear. It is strenuous. Nonetheless, most of the time, you carry on the conversation successfully. How? You use the information from the context and ‚Äúpredict‚Äù what the other person will say next when their speech is moderately distorted, and you are attending to the context.\nWhat would happen if the other person speaks faster or slower than they‚Äôd generally speak?\nTo answer similar questions, we conducted two experiments with two groups of native German speakers. In Experiment 1, they listened to the sentences presented at a normal and fast speech rate (0.65x), while in Experiment 2, they listened to the sentences presented at a normal and slow speech rate (1.35x). Apart from the speed, sentences were identical in both experiments: 120 high and 120 low predictability sentences were presented. For example, Sie findet die B√§lle (EN: She finds the balls) is a low predictability sentence, and Sie jonliert die B√§lle (EN: She juggles the balls) is a high predictability sentence. We expected that when the speech rate increases (i.e., fast speech), processing demand for degraded speech increases. Furthermore, listeners have lesser time than normal speech to process the context information. Hence, forming predictions is difficult and less efficient. On the other hand, we expected that when the speech rate decreases (i.e., slow speech), the processing demand for degraded speech reduces. Listeners have more time than normal speech to process the unfolding speech, including the context. Hence, the intelligibility of degraded speech increases and the contextual facilitation is amplified compared to the normal speech rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated effects of the model accounting for the correct word recognition in Experiment 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed effects\nEstimate\nStd. Error\nz value\np value\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n1.34\n.24\n5.58\n&lt;.001\n\n\nSpeech rate (Fast)\n-.98\n.24\n-4.16\n&lt;.001\n\n\nTarget word predictability (High)\n2.42\n.28\n8.55\n&lt;.001\n\n\nSpeech rate x target word predictability\n1.06\n.42\n2.50\n.012\n\n\n\nAs we had expected, the results of Experiment 1 showed a significant interaction between speech rate and predictability. Contextual facilitation decreased as the speech rate increased. Importantly, the decrease was driven by the reduced word recognition in the low predictability sentences; lexico-semantic cues in the high predictability sentences are more robust than in low predictability sentences. When the processing time is short, it reduces the activation of likely sentence endings, especially when the context is less constraining.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated effects of the model accounting for the correct word recognition in Experiment 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed effects\nEstimate\nStd. Error\nz value\np value\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n1.41\n.23\n6.20\n&lt;.001\n\n\nSpeech rate (Slow)\n-.08\n.14\n-.57\n.568\n\n\nTarget word predictability (High)\n2.58\n.30\n8.65\n&lt;.001\n\n\nSpeech rate x target word predictability\n.44\n.27\n1.65\n.099\n\n\n\nThe results of Experiment 2, however, were not as we had expected. The word recognition accuracy did not increase with a decrease in speech rate (i.e., when the speech became slower). Slow speech provides more time to process the (context) information but does not increase word recognition disproportionately in high or low predictability sentences. It indicates that although slow speech reduces the effortful listening of degraded speech, it does not benefit comprehension and contextual facilitation any more than normal speech.\nIn short, the findings of our experiments show that slowing down a moderately degraded speech does not amplify the facilitatory effect provided the context information. However, an increase in speech rate has a detrimental impact on identifying words that are less predictable from the context. \n\n\n\nLerner, Y., Honey, C. J., Katkov, M., & Hasson, U. (2014).
