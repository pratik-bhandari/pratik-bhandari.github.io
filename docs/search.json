    "text": "In a dimly lit room, I am in a bed surrounded by green people: green gowns and green masks. They talk gibberish. I understand a few words: Maya, female, 28, chest, anaesthesia, Glassman, hour. They are preparing me and waiting for Dr Glassman to arrive.\n“My name is Nurse Mark. You are in the operation room. Do you understand, Miss Maya?” I nod my head. He seems to not understand. I say, “Yes.” He smiles. He moves me under two giant inverted-umbrella-like monsters. They look like a constellation of LED lights you often see in Gray’s Anatomy. Suddenly they glow, and my eyes are blinded for a moment. Dr Glassman is here.\n“Hello, Maya! How are you doing?”\n“Okay. Waiting it to start and get over with. You are using local, right?”\n“Good then. You didn’t want general. So.”\n“I’ve already experienced your general anesthesia. This time I want to be awake the whole time. I want to see you operate on me. I mean, how it works.”\n“Let’s see if you can see. You know that there will be a drape.”\nOh crap. I’d forgotten about the drape. They hide my head.\n“Oh.”\n\nHe moves the surgical display monitor here and there. (This is fancy!) I can see my chest on it. Reminds of Dashain when after beheading a goat, men in the village would shave it off and apply turmeric powder on its body before cutting it into pieces. Betadine had made my chest look just like the goat’s yellow stomach. I still have my head intact, and Dr Glassman is not Frankenstein.\nMark arranges the drapes around me. The monitor is hidden now. All I see is Green. Anaesthesia is already doing its job – I can no longer feel my chest. A guy comes near my ear and says, “You will feel dizzy and a bit cold. I have given a medication.” I read his name: “Dr Truman, Anaesthesia”. I chuckle. Mark had opened an IV line for him in my left arm.\nWait! Didn’t Dr Glassman just say local anaesthesia? Why would I feel dizzy? Did Truman just say I won’t be able to move? How will I breathe then? They had already put an oxygen tube in and around my nose. Am I duped into all this? God.\nMy head! It’s hurting now. I feel tired. Sleepy. Why are my eyelids closing? I don’t want to sleep. I just want to experience everything that happens during the operation. I am here also to remind Dr Glassman to take pictures. (He has an iPhone, better than mine.) MRI images do not satisfy the eagerness of human eyes. A piece of paper with numbers on it does not give you a complete picture. Doctors might form an image out of it, but I have to see the thing itself. Don’t you wish to see the face of your killer before he is sentenced to death? Just that you don’t survive the murder attempt, and death sentences are either not possible or are not real solutions. Still, the wish remains. Sorry, I went a bit emotional. Philosophical.\nStruggling not to close the eyelids, I ask Dr Glassman how it is going there. He doesn’t say a thing. Loud. “Hey Doctor. I don’t want to sleep. I will sing songs. Is that okay?”\n“Hmm”\nI don’t know if he is talking to me or saying something to the other assisting doctor.\nI don’t care. I can’t care. I first go with Nabin K Bhattarai: “Khadai nakhako bish le jyudai maryo”. Then some of Coldplay, I think. English, Nepali, Hindi all mixed up – my frustrations are spelt out then: ‘Fuck’, ‘Muji’, ‘Madarchod’, … Some ill-formed sentences to some loving motherfuckers. I get them all out. Everyone here has their own shit to care about to make the operation successful despite my practice for the audition of Nepal Idol and Himalaya Roadies.\nBreathing is getting difficult. Someone is stabbing me. My chest hurts. I turn left – the clock says 3:30. Does the anaesthesia wear off after 1 hour? When did they give the anaesthesia? It is all because I resisted sleep. People say sleep is essential. Or maybe I just dozed off due to the anaesthesia, and this is a dream. I will wake up without any pain. But what about this pain right now? Remember what Descartes said: what you feel is real. Did he really say that? Fuck Descartes. He never experienced anaesthesia. Screw all armchair philosophers who don’t have any experience of altered consciousness.\n\nAhhh!!! No!!! Needles on my chest. Is Dr Glassman already sewing? I clench my fist with every penetration of the needle. “Wow, the surgery was short!” Nothing. Louder. “No. It hurts!” Nothing. Don’t they hear me? Am I just speaking inside my head? Or am I just paralyzed? I’ll be one of those stories of patients awake during surgeries feeling all the pain but unable to speak.\nI am in pain now. The pain is getting unbearable. In despair, minutes feel like an eternity. When the pain is beyond ‘unbearable’, the concept of time evaporates into the ether. It is just pain and you.\n“Congratulations! We have removed the tumor.” Dr Glassman removes the drape and winks with his usual “Cancer is canceled.”\nI look down where my breast used to be. Sure, ‘Cancer is cancelled.’"

    "text": "These are some of the works I have undertaken in the past few years.\n\nLanguage Comprehension in a Noisy Channel\nI was a part of project A4 at the Collaborative Research Center (SFB 1102) Information Density and Linguistic Encoding at Saarland University. The project aims to ‘examine how noise (or the effect of reduced hearing ability) will influence language comprehension, and how natural language generation systems can adapt their output to minimize the risk of misunderstanding’. With Prof. Vera Demberg, Prof. Jutta Kray and Prof. Dietrich Klakow as the PIs of the project, I investigated behavioural and neural correlates of the interaction between top-down predictive language processing and bottom-up auditory perceptual processing and how ‘noise in the signal’ interacts with these functions. This project also contributed to my doctoral research (Nov 2018-Dec 2022).\n\n\nCOVIDiSTRESS global survey\nI was a part of an international consortium of researchers who gathered together to collect data on people’s psychological response to covid-19 pandemic in 48 countries. The study conducted by this consortium investigated the differences in responses across countries and cultures, and the impact of these differences in people’s behavior, their coping and trust in governments’ preventive measures. A couple of findings of this very early study were: Those who were most concerned over the virus trusted the government measures where the policies were strict; and one of the primary factors that contributed to mental distress was the concern over a disease. There were within and between country variations, undoubtedly.\n\n\nPredictability in Bilingual Language Processing\nI conducted a research project to investigate the effect of predictability on semantic processing and metacognitive processing in Spanish-Basque bilinguals during my Master in Cognitive Neuroscience of Language at the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language (Sep 2017-Sep 2018). In 2 experiments, I found that predictability enhanced semantic and metacognitive processing in Basque (low proficiency language) when Basque words were presented as predictable trials. Such an effect of predictability was absent in Spanish (high proficiency language). This research project resulted in my Master’s thesis, supervised by Prof. David Soto.\n\n\nExecutive Control in Bilinguals\nI was involved in several research projects as a research intern at Prof. Ramesh Kumar Mishra’s Action Control and Cognition Lab at the Center for Neural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Hyderabad, India (Dec 2015-May 2017).\n\nSensitivity to Contextual Factors\nIn this research, we examined bilinguals’ sensitivity to social-conversational context: if the presence of interlocutors modulates their executive control. We found that compared to low proficient bilinguals, high proficient bilinguals bring in higher executive control when the context demands higher monitoring due to the presence of diverse interlocutors (i.e., those who differ in their language profile) randomly.\n\n\nLanguage Proficiency and Aging\nThis research examined if second language proficiency modulates executive control in older adults. We found that there was no bilingual advantage: second language proficiency did not have any effect on executive control measures in older Telugu-English bilinguals.\n\n\n\nNeurodiversity\nI was a speech-language pathologist for over four years in Nepal: a student clinician for over three years, a clinical intern for a year, and then some months of independent practice. Based on these experiences and my personal experience with autism, I expressed concern with my co-author Mr Pratik Khanal, a public health expert, regarding the potential side effects of the “no cure” advocacy in correspondence to a Lancet editorial. We argue that “no cure” could hinder care to those in need, especially in countries where health care resources are poor and the available resources are poorly distributed."

    "text": "A couple of days ago, our paper on the role of attention in the facilitatory effect of predictability in the comprehension of degraded speech was published in Language and Cognition.\nIn an earlier paper published in the section Auditory Cognitive Neuroscience of Frontiers in Psychology, we had shown that listeners utilize context in a sentence that facilitates their comprehension of a degraded speech. Say, in a high predictability sentence like, “She dribbles the ball”, identification of “ball” is facilitated by its preceding context compared to a low predictability sentence like, “She buys a ball”. This Language and Cognition paper shows that such facilitation is possible only when listeners pay attention to the sentence context and process it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one experiment, we asked participants to listen to a degraded speech and report only the final word of a sentence they heard. It restricted their attention to the target word at the sentence-final position (e.g., “ball”). In another experiment, they were asked to report the entire sentence. This task did not restrict their attention to any part of the sentence; they could attend to the sentence context that preceded the target word. The results showed that the effect of predictability—a significant difference in the accuracy of recognition of the words like “ball” between high and low predictability sentences—was observed only in the second case when the participants reported the entire sentence. While reporting only the final word, there was no such effect of predictability.\nOur findings suggest that when they report only the sentence-final target word, listeners’ attention is restricted to a particular time point as the speech unfolds in time. They do not process the context information that precedes the target word. Hence, there was no effect of predictability. On the contrary, while reporting the entire sentence, they also attend to the sentence context. They process the context information forming predictions about upcoming linguistic units; in this case, the prediction is about the sentence-final target word. Accuracy is lower for words that are less predictable from the context than those that are more predictable from the context.\nAll in all, our findings show that prediction in language processing is not an automatic process. Especially in an adverse listening condition, listeners have to attend to the context information to get any benefit from the context. In other words, attention is a prerequisite to processing context information and generating linguistic predictions.\nAttention is all you need. Not all, but something you need to start with."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was first introduced to the formal practice of meditation when I was in lower secondary school. After that, there were many instances of following spiritual schools and gurus for the sake of learning how to meditate. It was never consistent, and I was never consistent. In the past few months, I have consistently meditated just by myself. Without a teacher, however, learning the skill of meditation is not an easy task to undertake. After weighing the pros and cons, I decided to learn from a teacher who is trained and knows better and can teach. I came across this app by Sam Harris in which there are different courses and routes of meditation practice, including one for beginners. [Sam is generally known for his expression on politics, philosophy, and religion. But this is not my concern at the moment.] Today marks the 25th day of my regular practice of following a guided meditation. I would recommend it to anyone. With the practice, I have begun to realize those aspects of ‘myself’ that had gone unnoticed earlier or had been noticed in readings. I have questions about life and existence, about self and consciousness, more than ever before. Probably this also depends on what one seeks from meditation. Why do you (want to) meditate? Do you think that meditation is the remedy to all the problems in your life: stress, negative emotions, anger, and so on? Maybe this is not the right approach to meditation, I opine. I definitely do not qualify to make a seasoned claim. But gleaning what I have glimpsed recently and what I had learnt from my intermittent practice in the past is that meditation is not the means to attain those ends. Meditation, I think, is about being mindful of the existence — the existence of thoughts, emotions, feelings, and sensations in one’s conscious awareness. Realizing and observing that everything we experience in our waking hours (probably while we sleep too) is merely the appearance of those experiences in the field of conscious awareness. And we identify this experience as ‘self’, an illusory self. This realization, even if momentary in the beginning, is enlightening [I am not using the word ‘enlightening’ in the same sense used in different Buddhist and Hindu traditions.] I can’t say for sure if I am under an illusion that I have glimpsed it: there are instances during meditation when I have momentarily observed the non-existence of ‘self’; there is no ‘I’. This might as well be an illusion in the end. With time and practice, things will be clearer for me. After all, you can see how often the word ‘I’ has been used in this writing — the self is extremely dominant. And semantics does matter, doesn’t it?"

    "text": "Fig.1 - Schematic representation of waveforms of different speech rates of clean speech. Taken from Lerner et al., 2014\n\n\n\nIn previous studies, we found that at a moderate level of speech degradation, listeners use context information that they attend to and use it to form predictions about the word that comes next in a sentence.\nLet’s take a very simplified example. Imagine you are speaking to someone over a cellphone, and the signal is poor, which distorts the speech that you hear. It is strenuous. Nonetheless, most of the time, you carry on the conversation successfully. How? You use the information from the context and “predict” what the other person will say next when their speech is moderately distorted, and you are attending to the context.\nWhat would happen if the other person speaks faster or slower than they’d generally speak?\nTo answer similar questions, we conducted two experiments with two groups of native German speakers. In Experiment 1, they listened to the sentences presented at a normal and fast speech rate (0.65x), while in Experiment 2, they listened to the sentences presented at a normal and slow speech rate (1.35x). Apart from the speed, sentences were identical in both experiments: 120 high and 120 low predictability sentences were presented. For example, Sie findet die Bälle (EN: She finds the balls) is a low predictability sentence, and Sie jonliert die Bälle (EN: She juggles the balls) is a high predictability sentence. We expected that when the speech rate increases (i.e., fast speech), processing demand for degraded speech increases. Furthermore, listeners have lesser time than normal speech to process the context information. Hence, forming predictions is difficult and less efficient. On the other hand, we expected that when the speech rate decreases (i.e., slow speech), the processing demand for degraded speech reduces. Listeners have more time than normal speech to process the unfolding speech, including the context. Hence, the intelligibility of degraded speech increases and the contextual facilitation is amplified compared to the normal speech rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated effects of the model accounting for the correct word recognition in Experiment 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed effects\nEstimate\nStd. Error\nz value\np value\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n1.34\n.24\n5.58\n<.001\n\n\nSpeech rate (Fast)\n-.98\n.24\n-4.16\n<.001\n\n\nTarget word predictability (High)\n2.42\n.28\n8.55\n<.001\n\n\nSpeech rate x target word predictability\n1.06\n.42\n2.50\n.012\n\n\n\nAs we had expected, the results of Experiment 1 showed a significant interaction between speech rate and predictability. Contextual facilitation decreased as the speech rate increased. Importantly, the decrease was driven by the reduced word recognition in the low predictability sentences; lexico-semantic cues in the high predictability sentences are more robust than in low predictability sentences. When the processing time is short, it reduces the activation of likely sentence endings, especially when the context is less constraining.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated effects of the model accounting for the correct word recognition in Experiment 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed effects\nEstimate\nStd. Error\nz value\np value\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n1.41\n.23\n6.20\n<.001\n\n\nSpeech rate (Slow)\n-.08\n.14\n-.57\n.568\n\n\nTarget word predictability (High)\n2.58\n.30\n8.65\n<.001\n\n\nSpeech rate x target word predictability\n.44\n.27\n1.65\n.099\n\n\n\nThe results of Experiment 2, however, were not as we had expected. The word recognition accuracy did not increase with a decrease in speech rate (i.e., when the speech became slower). Slow speech provides more time to process the (context) information but does not increase word recognition disproportionately in high or low predictability sentences. It indicates that although slow speech reduces the effortful listening of degraded speech, it does not benefit comprehension and contextual facilitation any more than normal speech.\nIn short, the findings of our experiments show that slowing down a moderately degraded speech does not amplify the facilitatory effect provided the context information. However, an increase in speech rate has a detrimental impact on identifying words that are less predictable from the context. \n\n\n\nLerner, Y., Honey, C. J., Katkov, M., & Hasson, U. (2014).

    "text": "The big day\nLet’s talk about the defence: my presentation and the Q&A session. I was allocated 30 minutes to talk about four years of research. It was followed by an hour-long Q&A session. In that hour, the committee members asked plenty of questions, some expected and some unexpected. (One committee member, who was in Saarbrücken, didn’t attend in person. I assumed he would; I never asked.) At that time, I couldn’t have guessed how long the Q&A had lasted: It neither felt like an eternity nor did it feel like a blink of an eye.\n\nPresentation\nI had my notes in the PowerPoint presentation, in the speaker notes, if you will. Trying to peek at it was distracting at times: Such was not the case in the earlier practice talks I had given in front of my colleagues and friends. The microphones were very distracting. I felt like I had to hear my voice from the overhead loudspeakers; otherwise, the audience wouldn’t hear me. But I realised later that it wasn’t the case. The online audience could hear me via the “room mic” placed near me. The in-person audience could have heard me even without the loudspeakers.\nI also lost my train of thought at least three points throughout the presentation, which means I likely said something random to get back on track. (Later people in the audience reported that they didn’t notice anything like that. Well, I guess they were being polite to me. After all, I had already passed the defence when I asked if they’d noticed me getting lost.) I’m saying now that I couldn’t deliver everything as I’d planned then.\n\n\nThe Q&A round\nThe word “defense” makes it sound as if someone is attacking you, and you are protecting yourself from the attack. We are programmed to feel that way from the time when we learn about dissertation, thesis, passing PhD, and …defence. Okay, so how did it go in my case? Not as bad as I anticipated. It was good. Some questions were anticipated, some not, and some: I had no clue how to answer. I believe all questions of different flavours are asked to test how a “defendant” responds in an intellectual/academic discussion. You should be ready to answer, or at least respond, to everything. Is that what we get evaluated on? I digress.\nIn general, I felt I could have answered many questions better than how and what I did. Good thing: I waited to reply after the question was asked. Didn’t rush. Most of the time, I took some time to think through what the questions were meant to ask, and then I sketched in a notepad what the answers could be. Then I responded. This approach was very beneficial when the questions were tricky and unanticipated and when I had never before looked at my studies from a particular point of view raised by a committee member. I heard that some audience members didn’t like me “writing something” before answering the question, as if I was “writing a book”. I don’t know what the committee members thought. And I don’t remember clearly if I even mentioned to the committee what I was doing. Maybe I didn’t. A mistake? The difficult and a bit problematic part was coordinating between online and in-person committee members when they were asking questions. In principle, it is the committee chair’s job to manage and organise who asks questions and for how long. But the mic in the room didn’t pick up the Chair’s voice, so I had to reiterate what he said to the online committee members. It could have been smoother than it was had everyone been present in person. And I had to entirely ignore the online audience after the presentation when I (and everyone in the room) was asked to leave the room for the committee members to decide the fate of my PhD."

With the benefit of hindsight, all the worries and nervousness and anxiety seem to be too intense than they could have been should have been. It is natural and maybe necessary to be worried to some extent, but not too much. (Having said that, if I travelled back in time before the defence and told myself not to worry so much, I doubt I would be any less worried or anxious.)\nI saved myself by taking advice from those who went through a similar phase before me. There are also plenty of instances where I could still have done better. Based on these, I would recommend the following, in no particular order, to someone who plans to defend their thesis:\n\nThe committee members are not there to attack you, as the word “defense” implies. They will test you, of course. But have an attitude of an academic/intellectual discussant.\nDo as many dry runs as possible. Present it to your lab members; get the bad news at home. Also, present it to people who are not very familiar with your work. Get input from a wider variety of audiences if your committee members have a diverse set of expertise.\nPrepare a script for what you’d want to say on each slide. Time your talk about being within the given time (30 minutes in most of the departments in UdS).\nConfirm with all committee members a day before the defence if they are attending regardless of the nature of the defence (in-person, online, or hybrid). There may be last-minute changes in their plans, and you might get information on time.\nDo a test run the day before the defence. 5. Make sure that all the instruments and IT equipment are functional. And on the day of defence, carry a spare laptop, just in case your laptop decides to give up on you.\nTry not to drain yourself with too much worry, anxiety, and nervousness. You know better than anyone else in the room about the content of the dissertation, the presentation, and the field of research: go with this confidence. Remember point 1, too.\n\nEliminate unnecessary sources of worries. Food and drinks are not primary concerns. They are manageable. Don’t put too much thought into them. Just get the damn wine and some cookies or cake or whatever. People aren’t there for food and drink. If you are like me, you’d have this conflict: “Down with the culture of PhD students serving food” vs “Attendees are my guests”. So, keep a balance. I repeat, direct your worries and concerns to their appropriate place.\nFinding a venue can be daunting. Try to get a place as soon as you have a date fixed. Writing emails to different department secretariats and room managers, waiting for their replies only to know that the rooms are booked, checking online room portals to find out that the rooms aren’t available on the date of your defence, the contact person of the room that is available is out of office… This is another source of avoidable worry and stress which can be managed.\n\nYou don’t have answers to all questions, especially the ones you did not anticipate and those that come from the PoV you had never considered before. It is okay not to know the exact answer to some questions. But, speculate. Formulate your speculation based on your data and results and the literature.\n\nThese are some thoughts on passing. I’ll likely write some more on navigating phd and academic research. Stay tuned."

Sleep well before the day of defence. If I were to do it again, I’d still organize the program in the morning, maybe at 9 and not 8. It saves hours and hours of anticipatory anxiety. You know your body; eat accordingly. Most importantly, don’t forget to take a bottle and a glass of water with you in the podium or stage. The 90-plus minutes of speaking dries your mouth, and you need hydration anyway. Sipping water also gives some time to organize your thoughts before responding to questions.\nYou don’t have answers to all questions, especially the ones you did not anticipate and those that come from the point of view you had never considered before. It is okay not to know the exact answer to some questions. But, speculate. Formulate your speculation based on your data and results and the literature.\nGet to know your committee members: their papers, other committees they have been in, the questions they tend to ask, and how kind they are3. Knowing your committee’s expertise, where they come from, and where they take you with their questions will help you anticipate some questions and prepare accordingly. For example, someone might focus more on experimental methods, while another member might focus on theoritical part of your research.\nRead. Make sure your dissertation is fresh in your mind while you are presenting and answering questions. It is tempting to think that you know what you’ve written. Of course you know. But do you know what statements could stand out as peculiar to the committee, to a reviewer who reads your dissertation? Be safe, do not falter while answering questions pertaining to such peculiarities. So, read. Side benefit: you’ll freshen up the citations in your memory.\n\nThere is always a next thing to do. A new thing to worry about. I passed PhD, and now I’m worrying about getting a postdoc position of my fit/choice. In hindsight, as time passes, what you accomplished doesn’t seem too big of a deal, past worries seem too exaggerated. But in the moment, the best thing to do is to manage the concerns and try to perform well. If you are preparing for a PhD defence, I wish you all the best!"
