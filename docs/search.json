    "text": "I am in a bed surrounded by green people: green gown, green mask, in dimly lit room. They talk gibberish. I understand only a few words: Maya, female, 28, chest, anaesthesia, Glassman, hour. They are preparing me and waiting for Dr. Glassman to arrive.\n“My name is Nurse Mark. You are in the operation room. Do you understand Miss Maya?” I nod my head. He seems to not understand. I say “Yes.” He smiles. He moves me under two big inverted-umbrella like monsters. They look like some sort of constellation of LED-lights you often see in Gray’s Anatomy. Suddenly they glow and my eyes are blinded for a moment. Dr. Glassman is here.\n“Hello, Maya! How are you doing?”\n“Okay. Waiting it to start and get over with. You are using local, right?”\n“Good then. You didn’t want general. So.”\n“I’ve already experienced your general anesthesia. This time I want to be awake the whole time. I want to see you operate on me. I mean, how it works.”\n“Let’s see if you can see. You know that there will be a drape.”\nOh crap. I’d forgotten about the drape. They hide my head.\n“Oh.”\n\nHe moves the surgical display monitor here and there. (This is fancy!) I can see my chest on it. Reminds of Dashain when after beheading a goat men in the village would shave it off and apply turmeric powder on it’s body before cutting it into pieces. Betadine had made my chest look just like the goat’s yellow stomach. I still have my head intact and Dr. Glassman is not Frankenstein.\nMark arranges drape around me. The monitor is hidden now. All I see is Green. Anaesthesia is already doing its job – I can no longer feel my chest. A guy comes near my ear and says, “You will feel dizzy and a bit cold. I have given a medication.” I read his name “Dr. Truman, Anaesthesia”; I chuckle. Mark had opened an IV line for him in my left arm.\nWait! Didn’t Dr. Glassman just say local anaesthesia? Why would I feel dizzy? Did Truman just say I won’t be able to move? How will I breath then? They had already put oxygen tube in and around my nose. Am I duped into all this? God.\nMy head! It’s hurting now. I feel tired. Sleepy. Why are my eyelids closing? I don’t want to sleep. I just want to experience everything that happens during the operation. I am here also to remind Dr. Glassman to take pictures. (He has an iPhone, better than mine.) MRI images do not satisfy the eagerness of human eyes. A piece of paper with numbers on it does not give you the picture. Doctors might form an image out if it, but I have to see the thing itself. Don’t you wish to see the face of your killer before he is sentenced to death? Just that you don’t survive the murder attempt, and death sentences are either not possible, or are not real solutions. Still, the wish remains. Sorry, I went a bit emotional. Philosophical.\nStruggling not to close the eyelids, I ask Dr. Glassman how is it going there. He doesn’t say a thing.\nLoud. “Hey Doctor. I don’t want to sleep. I will sing songs. Is that okay?”\n“Hmm”\nI don’t know if he is talking to me or saying something to the other assisting doctor.\n\nI don’t care. I can’t care. I first go with Nabin K Bhattarai: “Khadai nakhako bish le jyudai maryo”. Then some of Coldplay I think. English, Nepali, Hindi all mixed up – my frustrations are spelled out then: ‘Fuck’, ‘Muji’, ‘Madarchod’, … Some ill-formed sentences to some loving motherfuckers. I get them all out. Everyone here has their own shit to care about to make the operation successful despite my practice for the audition of Nepal Idol and Himalaya Roadies.\n\nBreathing is getting difficult. Someone is stabbing me. My chest hurts. I turn left – the clock says 3:30. Does the anaesthesia wear off after 1 hour? When did they give the anaesthesia? It is all because I resisted sleep. People say sleep is important. Or maybe I just dozed off due to the anaesthesia and this is a dream. I will wake up without any pain. But what about this pain right now? Remember what Descartes said: what you feel is real. Did he really say that? Fuck Descartes. He never experienced anaesthesia. Screw all armchair philosophers who don’t have any experience of altered consciousness.\n\nNeedles on my chest. Ahhh!!! No!!!\nIs Dr. Glassman already sewing? I clinch my fist on every penetration of the needle.\n“Wow, the surgery was short!”\nNothing.\nLouder. “No. It hurts!”\nNothing.\nDon’t they hear me? Am I just speaking inside my head? Or am I just, paralyzed? I’ll be one of those stories of patients being awake during surgeries feeling all the pain but unable to speak.\n\nThe pain is getting unbearable. In pain, minutes feel like eternity. When the pain is beyond ‘unbearable’, the concept of time evaporates into ether. It is just pain and you. I am with pain now.\n\n“Congratulations! We have removed the tumor.” Dr. Glassman removes the drape and winks with his usual “Cancer is canceled.”\nI look down where my breast used to be. Sure, ‘Cancer is canceled.’"

    "text": "These are some of the works that I have undertaken in the past few years.\n\nLanguage Comprehension in a Noisy Channel\nI am a part of the project A4 at the Collaborative Research Center (SFB 11O2) Information Density and Linguistic Encoding in Saarland University. The project aims to ‘examine how noise (or the effect of reduced hearing ability) will influence language comprehension, and how natural language generation systems can adapt their output to minimize the risk of misunderstanding’. With Prof. Vera Demberg, Prof. Jutta Kray and Prof. Dietrich Klakow as the PIs of the project, I investigate behavioral and neural correlates of the interaction between top-down predictive language processing and bottom-up auditory perceptual processing, and how ‘noise in the signal’ interacts with these functions. This project also contributes to my doctoral research (Nov 2018 - present).\n\n\nCOVIDiSTRESS global survey\nI was a part of an international consortium of researchers who gathered together to collect data on people’s psychological response to covid-19 pandemic in 48 countries. The study conducted by this consortium investigated the differences in responses across countries and cultures, and the impact of these differences in people’s behavior, their coping and trust in governments’ preventive measures. A couple of findings of this very early study were: Those who were most concerned over the virus trusted the government measures where the policies were strict; and one of the primary factors that contributed to mental distress was the concern over a disease. There were within and between country variations, undoubtedly.\n\n\nPredictability in Bilingual Language Processing\nI conducted a research project to investigate the effect of predictability on semantic processing and metacognitive processing in Spanish-Basque bilinguals during my Master in Cognitive Neuroscience of Language at the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language (Sep 2017 - Sep 2018). In 2 experiments, I found that predictability enhanced semantic and metacognitive processing in Basque (low proficiency language) when Basque words were presented as predictable trials. Such effect of predictability was absent in Spanish (high proficiency language). This research project resulted in my Master thesis supervised by Prof. David Soto.\n\n\nExecutive Control in Bilinguals\nI was involved in a number of research projects as a research intern at Prof. Ramesh Kumar Mishra’s Action Control and Cognition Lab at the Center for Neural and Cognitive Sciences in the University of Hyderabad, India (Dec 2015 - May 2017).\n\nSensitivity to Contextual Factors\nIn this research we examined bilinguals’ sensitivity to social-conversational context: if their executive control is modulated by the presence of interlocutors. We found that compared to low proficient bilinguals, high proficient bilinguals bring in higher executive control when the context demands higher monitoring due to the presence of diverse interlocutors (i.e., those who differ in their language profile) randomly.\n\n\nLanguage Proficiency and Aging\nThis research examined if second language proficiency modulates executive control in older adults. We found that there was no bilingual advantage: second language proficiency did not have any effect on executive control measures in older Telugu-English bilinguals.\n\n\n\nNeurodiversity\nThis was a letter based on personal experience with autism, and my clinical experience; I was a speech-language pathologist for over 4 years in Nepal (student clinician for more than three years, clinical intern for a year, then some months of independent parctice). I expressed tlhis concern in The Lancet, along with my co-author Mr. Pratik Khanal, regarding the “no cure” advocacy and the neurodiversity movement as someone from an underdeveloped country."

    "title": "Glimpsing through Meditation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I was first introduced to the formal practice of meditation when I was in lower secondary school. After that, there were many instances of following spiritual schools and gurus for the sake of learning how to meditate. It was never consistent and I was never consistent. In the past few months, I have been fairly consistent meditating just by myself. Without a teacher, however, learning the skill of meditation is not an easy task to undertake. After weighing the pros and cons, I decided to learn from a teacher, from someone who is trained and knows better, someone who can teach. I came across this app by Sam Harris in which there are different courses and routes of meditation practice including one for beginners. [Sam is generally known for his expression on politics, philosophy, and religion. But this is not my concern at the moment.] Today marks the 25th day of my regular practice of following a guided meditation. I would recommend it to anyone. With the practice, I have begun to realize those aspects of ‘myself’ that had gone unnoticed earlier or had been noticed in readings. I have questions about life and existence, about self and consciousness more than ever before. Probably this also depends on what one seeks from meditation. Why do you (want to) meditate? Do you think that meditation is the remedy to all the problems in your life: stress, negative emotions, anger, and so on? Maybe this is not the right approach to meditation, I opine. I definitely do not qualify to make a seasoned claim. But gleaning what I have glimpsed in recent days and what I had learnt from my intermittent practice in the past is that meditation is not the means to attain those ends. Meditation, I think, is about being mindful of the existence — the existence of thoughts, emotions, feelings, and sensations in one’s conscious awareness. Realizing and observing that everything we experience in our waking hours (probably while we sleep as well) is merely the appearance of those experiences in the field of conscious awareness. And we identify this experience as ‘self’, an illusory self. This realization, even if momentary in the beginning, is enlightening [I am not using the word ‘enlightening’ in the same sense that is used in different Buddhist and Hindu traditions.] I can’t say for sure if I am under an illusion that I have glimpsed it: there are instances during meditation when I have momentarily observed the non-existence of ‘self’; there is no ‘I’. This might as well be an illusion in the end. With time and practice, things will be clearer for me. After all, you can see how many times the word ‘I’ has been used in this writing — the self is so dominant. And semantics does matter, doesn’t it?"

    "text": "One of the main reasons for using git is version control. No longer naming the files as ‘final-draft’, ‘finaly-draft2’, ‘final-finaldraft_pb’, etc. You can see what changes have been made incrementally: Compare the version of the document created 10 days ago with the recent one.\n\nExample:\nSay we have a file 01_chapter.Rmd. It is the first chapter of my thesis. I have just made some changes in it. Before git add <file>, I want to compare these changes with the latest version that I have already committed. Then, this is what I do1:\n\ngit diff HEAD 01_chapter.Rmd\n# OR\ngit diff master:01_chapter.Rmd 01_chapter.Rmd\n\nIf 01_chapter.Rmd is not in the working directory then provide the path to it.\nOther different comparisons:\n\ngit diff HEAD~2 01_chapter.Rmd\n# OR\ngit diff master~2:01_chapter.Rmd 01_chapter.Rmd\n#--\n\ngit diff master~3:01_chapter.Rmd master~1:01_chapter.Rmd\n\nYou got the idea.\nThe global comparison of all files is just git diff which I do not prefer.\n\nTip: If you are working on RStudio, its GUI shows the changes in files since the last commit, including what files are added or deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n More in here↩︎"

Then I create a local R project in R Studio, and connect it to the remote git repo.

The -D is a hard delete!\nMerge branches locally:\n\ngit checkout main #First switch to the main/master branch\ngit merge BranchIwantToMerge #The branch still exists after merging\n\nThis was a dirty note down ;)\nOther frequently used commands are git pull, git merge, git rm -r --cached, etc.\nTune in for notes on frequently used R, bash and git commands."
