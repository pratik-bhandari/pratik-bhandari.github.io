:::{.callout-note}
I am in the job market for a postdoc position starting January 2023.
Get in touch by email (`postdoc@pratikb.com`) or any [other media](./contents/contact.html#other-online-presence).
:::

I am a doctoral researcher at the Collaborative Research Center ([SFB 1102](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de)) at Saarland University.
I successfully defended my PhD on December 7.
In my PhD, supervised by [Prof. Vera Demberg](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/demberg/members/verademberg.html) and [Prof. Jutta Kray](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/kray/team/jk.html),
I focused on understanding how we make sense of spoken language in adverse listening conditions,
under the theoretical framework of predictive processing and the noisy channel model of communication.
(Click [here](./contents/projects/index.html) to see my non-PhD research projects on various domains of cognitive science, including psychology and psycholinguistics.)
