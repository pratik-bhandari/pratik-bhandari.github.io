## Actively seeking job

I am in the job market in academia (postdoc position) as well as in industry (consultant, writer, data scientist, researcher).
Get in touch by email (<a href="mailto:postdoc@pratikb.com">postdoc@pratikb.com</a> or <a href="mailto:work@pratikb.com">work@pratikb.com</a>) if you have a position that you'd like to offer me or recommend. I'd highly appreciate it.
:::

I recently completed my PhD from Saarland University, where I studied psychology and language sciences.
My research focused on understanding how we use context information to make sense of spoken language in adverse listening conditions.
Before this, I studied metacognition and executive control mechanism in bilinguals.
I used behavioural and electrophysiological methods, like eye-tracking and EEG, including online experiments/surveys.
Scroll down to see my [academic qualifications](#education) and [selected publications](#publications).
Click [here](./contents/projects/index.html) to see the research projects I have undertaken across various domains of cognitive science,
including psychology and psycholinguistics.

<!---

What I expect from a job and what I can contribute:

**Academia**:
I wish to diversify my research fields and methodologies without making the postdoc research a continuity of the PhD.
I intend to join a lab that does interdisciplinary research and fosters collaborations.
There I would bring my training and experience in psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience and
would expect opportunities to work with experts in other fields, like neuroimaging, computational modelling, and philosophy, to name a few.
Questions about human and/or machine cognition, including language processing, memory, attention, metacognition, and (un)conscious awareness,
would fit my current research interests. 

**Industry**:
I wish to use the skills and expertise I have gained to solve real-world problems;
I expect the job to be challenging.
I have over six years of experience and expertise in project management, academic writing, data analysis and visualisation, programming, and conducting research.
I enjoy working with data (wrangling, statistical analysis, and visualisation), documenting codes, and writing reports and papers.
My experience in academic research can be used for consultation — to make an informed and educated decision,
especially if a company’s work revolves around applied health sciences, psychology, linguistics, or other similar areas.-->
<!-- I can also see myself engaged in analysing and visualizing data to gain insights from them. -->

<!--*There may be research domains or industry positions I have not mentioned above that can utilise my skills and expertise.*
*Let’s talk about them and work together.*
*I am just an email away!*-->
