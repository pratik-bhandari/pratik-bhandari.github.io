üôè Welcome! <!-- <i class="bi bi-arrow-right-circle-fill"></i> -->

I am a son, brother, and uncle deeply concerned about the devastating effects of climate change on people‚Äôs livelihoods.

:::

Wearing different hats as a researcher, research project manager and coordinator, and data analyst for more than 6 years, I have dedicated my work to gaining insights from data across a wide range of [projects](./contents/projects/index.html), from neurodiversity and bilingualism to speech processing and climate science. I was also invited by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology to prepare higher education policy recommendations for Nepal.

I am skilled in research project management and a variety of research and data analysis methods, including quantitative and qualitative analysis, as well as computational modelling.

I am currently seeking new opportunities and am open to relocating anywhere in Europe and South Asia. Let‚Äôs set up a call to chat about your organization‚Äôs needs and how I may be able to help!

<!--I am skilled in a variety of data analysis methods, including quantitative and qualitative analysis as well as computational modeling. Currently, I am studying the complex interaction of different cyclical events (e.g., El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation) and deforestation and their effects on rainfall and cereal production in the Congo River Basin.-->
