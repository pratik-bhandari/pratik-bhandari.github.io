:::{#intro}

üôè Welcome! <!-- <i class="bi bi-arrow-right-circle-fill"></i> -->

I am Pratik --- a seasoned generalist with expertise and a diverse skill set spanning cognitive science and climate science.

:::

<!--Throughout my career, I have worn different hats: academic researcher, *project manager* and coordinator, *data analyst*, *curriculum developer*, and *writer and editor*. 
I have worked across a wide range of [projects](./contents/projects/index.html), like neurodiversity and neural processes in language processing to the effects of covid-19 and computational climate change.
With high regards in institutes like, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, I have been invited as a rapportoer to provide policy report and recommendations to improve cogniitve science education in Nepal.
My collaboration spans across **all habitable continents**!-->

In my dynamic journey, I have excelled in roles such as academic researcher, project manager, coordinator, data analyst, curriculum developer, writer, and editor.
My work encompasses diverse [projects](./contents/projects/index.html), from multilingualism and language processing to the effects of COVID-19 and computational climate change.
As a rapporteur for institutions like the Norwegian University of Science and Technology,
I have provided policy reports to improve cognitive science education in Nepal.
I have established successful collaborations worldwide!

*I believe managing a project is about more than just reaching milestones.
It is about having a strategic vision right from the outset.
I have worked in seemingly different sectors, including those that don‚Äôt have a functioning project (e.g., many hospitals in Nepal).
And there are projects in India, Spain, and India that I have collboratively steered to success.
With this multifaceted expertise, unique professional and personal perspectives, global collaborations, and proven track record,
I can provide services tailored to your unique needs, no matter the company size.*
